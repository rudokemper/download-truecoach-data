### A2) Meadows row

### B1) Dumbbell Shoulder Press
Make sure to angle your elbows "in" - meaning just like when you "breal" the bar, or keep your shoulders "tucked into your back pockets" when doing push ups, shoulder press is the same.  Seated upright with a slight lean back on the bench, press up with elbows close to a 45* angle.  
  
Work up to a heavy set of 8 without supersetting,  
  
then  
  
10 reps x 4 sets with the heavy weight and start the superset

##### Result
*Did 50*

### B2) Pronated Pull-up
AMRAP each set  
subtract 1 rep from the top set for each set for 5 sets (yes, 1 extra set for this exercise)

##### Result

### C) Abs
